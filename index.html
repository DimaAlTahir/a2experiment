                            Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS ( 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician,
                            computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
                            Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
                            providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
                            which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
                            Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
                            Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality,

                        During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park.
                        The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley
                        and Turing's was that genius."

                        Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London, while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine)
                        at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design
                        of a stored-program computer.[106] Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper,
                        but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division,
                        it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own". Although ACE was a feasible design,
                        the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned.
                        In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery
                        that was not published in his lifetime.[108] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence.
                        It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it,
                        including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built
                        until after his death.

                        In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester.
                        A year later, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one
                        of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for
                        this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine,
                        the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.

                        In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne,
                        began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.[114] In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing "ran" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.[115] According to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess."[116] The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie,
                        although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife, Isabel.

                        His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative,
                        and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.

                        When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece
                        "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns
                        and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across
                        space, termed a reaction-diffusion system, could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis". Although published before
                        the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is
                        considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.
